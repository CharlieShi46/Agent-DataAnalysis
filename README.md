# Agent-DataAnalysis
This is a streamlined CSV data analysis assistant. Users upload a CSV file and ask questions in plain language. The app leverages an OpenAI model to analyze the data, returning either textual answers, tables, or visualizations such as bar, line, and scatter charts, all displayed within the interface.
